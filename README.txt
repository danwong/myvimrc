This is my current vimrc!
To use, check if you have a .vim directory (ls -a)
Then, check if you have ~/.vim/colors directory. If not, go ahead and make that directory.
Lastly, copy the Dark theme into the colors folder (cp Molokai-Dark.vim ~/.vim/colors/Molokai-Dark.vim)
and the vimrc (cp vimrc ~/.vimrc)
